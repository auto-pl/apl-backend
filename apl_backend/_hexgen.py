"""Map hex generation utility.

This module makes the map hex coordinates available to the web app.
This process consists of the following steps.

1. Retrieving the hex coordinates of various bases through the PS2 API
2. Converting these hex coordinates into a set of hexagons defined in
   Cartesian coordinates
3. Merging these individual hexagons into a single continuous outline
   (i.e. a closed polygon)
4. Serialising this polygon's SVG representation

This serialised representation, along with the relative offset from the
global map origin, can then be stored in a database or on disk to be
accessed from the web app as needed.
